# Assistant-Python
Create a assistant with Python, using Google speech API's and Connecting to Watson Assistant

#### This code was developed to create your own virtual assistant, currently it reads the latest news (Brazilian) google news, play music in Spotify, speaks the weather temperature in your city.

#### Other features: creating audio previews to generate conversation.

1. Create your default audios in the 'create_audio.py' and add them to the 'audio' folder (if they are not added directly)

2. 'main.py', it executes and waits for a voice command, if it identifies keywords it invokes the methods referring to them

3. Note: 'playsound' is used for playback on windows, referring to Mac and Linux are in the file 'cria_audio.py'. The Google API used will be disabled, I will update soon with the new one ('tallud.py' comment)
